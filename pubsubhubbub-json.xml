      <t>PubSubHubbub [TODO: xref] defines a protocol for subscribing to
      notifications of new or modified items in an Atom or RSS feed. This
      specification defines an alternative payload format that can be used to
      subscribe to JSON-based stream resources.</t>

      <t>This protocol is intended only to provide a basic transport format
      for shipping JSON data payloads. This specification does not define the
      format of such data payloads except to say that they must be JSON
      objects. Other specifications may define specific payload formats to
      enable specific application use-cases.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="notification-format" title="Notification Message Format">
      <t>This section defines an envelope that is used to deliver a sequence
      of data payloads in the form of a JSON document.</t>

      <t>The root of the JSON document is a JSON object containing a single
      property called <spanx style="verb">items</spanx>. The value of this
      property is a JSON array. Each of the items in the JSON array is a JSON
      object representing a payload object. The properties of this object are
      not defined by this specification.</t>

      <section title="Discovery Document Format">
        <t>This section defines an variation on the basic notification
        envelope described in <xref target="notification-format"></xref> that
        can be used by the publisher to discover the locations of its the
        available hubs for the topic and optionally to obtain a backlog of
        payload items in order to "catch up" on payload objects for which
        notifications were not received for some reason.</t>
